Uninstallation
==============

You can easily uninstall MSM by just deleting the following files:

* /etc/init.d/msm
* /etc/cron.d/msm
* /etc/bash_completion.d/msm
* /etc/msm.conf
* /usr/local/bin/msm

This will leave you with just the `/opt/msm` directory which contains all your servers and backups.
