Server Configuration(kbe/res/server/kbengine_defs.xml)
====================

If you need to change the configuration of the engine, as long as the inheritance ({newproject}[/res/server/kbengine.xml]) 
this configuration file and overwrite the corresponding section kbengine_defs.xml, but doing so will not damage the engine settings, 
there is no conflict in the development along with updated engine or multiple projects.
